# Mobile Application Project

## Overview

This project is a Java-based mobile application that includes services for managing contacts, tasks, and appointments. It incorporates code and unit tests from previous milestones and is designed to meet specific customer requirements.

## Project Structure

- ContactService: Manages contact-related operations.
- TaskService: Manages task-related operations.
- AppointmentService: Manages appointment-related operations.

## Reflections on My Projects
1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring that my Java code is both functional and secure involves a multi-faceted approach. I start by implementing comprehensive testing strategies, which include unit tests, integration tests, and automated tests. For instance, I use JUnit for unit testing, which helps verify that individual components of my code work as expected. Integration tests ensure that different parts of the application interact correctly, while automated tests, facilitated by tools like Jenkins, help continuously validate code changes and identify issues early in the development cycle.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program begins with thorough requirements gathering. I engage with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and user feedback to understand their needs and expectations. For instance, in my recent project involving a patrol route scheduling dashboard, I worked closely with city officials to understand their requirements for data visualization and reporting. I then translated these needs into functional specifications and user stories that guided the development process. Iterative feedback loops and user testing sessions further refined the software to ensure it met user expectations and provided a seamless experience.

3. How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software is methodical and user-centered. I start by defining the problem and understanding the project requirements in detail. This involves creating user personas, journey maps, and wireframes to visualize the softwareâ€™s functionality and user interface. I prioritize modular design principles to ensure the software is scalable and maintainable. For instance, in my recent work with a Next.js project, I utilized reusable components and implemented a clear separation of concerns to enhance code manageability. I also consider performance and usability factors during the design phase, ensuring that the software is not only functional but also efficient and user-friendly. Regular design reviews and iterations based on feedback help to refine the design and address any emerging challenges.
